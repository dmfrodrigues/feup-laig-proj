## Projects

### [TP1 - Scene Graph](TP1)

[Link to scene rendering](https://dmfrodrigues.github.io/feup-laig-proj/TP1/?file=LAIG_TP1_XML_T2_G04.xml)

- Hereditarity of materials and textures was implemented using two stacks, which are pushed (`XMLscene.pushAppearance()`) and popped (`XMLscene.popAppearance()`) similarly to CGFscene.pushMatrix() and CGFscene.popMatrix(). Current material and texture are set using `XMLscene.setAppearance(material, texture)`.

- Scene
  - Our scene is a bedroom with a bed, a table with a book and a globe, a door, a lamp, a TV and a window
